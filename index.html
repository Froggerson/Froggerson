      <p class="argument">Let's get this out of the way: <span class="highlight">climate change is happening right now</span>, and if we don't something, its effects will have a negative effect
      on the future. It can be scary to go about and change things by ourselves, but luckily for us
      UCSD offers a bunch of organizations that will help students "bend the curve", a phrase that refers
      to reducing the amount of CO2 emmissions we release on a year to year basis. Now is the perfect time to

    <div class="image-and-text">
      <p class="argument">Of course it will! Even if you do not actively participate in
      fighting against climate change right now, finding an group that does will help you gain awareness
    about strategies that will make a difference. You'll make new friends and work with a group of people
    who know what they are doing. You don't need to participate in a rally or lead a protest
  to reverse the effects of climate change; you can teach others, make small changes to your lifestyle,
get your friends involved, or even talk about it casually in conversation. <span class="highlight">College is a great time</span> to do that, and nothing is better than meeting new people who believe
in the same causes as you do! Let's take a look at what UCSD has to offer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Creating new technology can help us reach an "80% reduction in CO2 emmissions by 2050", while
                  teaching others can spread awareness about the issue and get people to be more involved (Ramanathan, 4-29). In this way,
                ESW is really "bending the curve!"</p>

                campaigns, lobbies politicians, and more! </p>
              <p>Political action is essential to fighting climate change. The government relies on the will
              of the people in order to operate. If we band together and let politicians know that climate is an urgent
            issue then the government can offer tax incentives for using sustainable techonologies,
          ban plastics, and regulate pollution which would lower CO2 emmisions on a much greater scale. Calpirg has
        already accomplished this in 2017, when they got the state of California to commit to 100% clean energy by 2045.</p>

                <p>It takes a lot of fuel to transport food from place to place. By growing crops on UCSD's campus, we can reduce the
                amount of CO2 that would have otherwise come from trucks delivering fresh produce. Furthermore, the community gardens use compost from
              the dining halls, which reduce the amount of methane that would have otherwise been released if the food waste were to simply rot away.</p>

              People who are most impacted by the effects of climate change come from low-income
            areas, even though they hardly contribute to CO2 emmissions. They do not have the means to migrate
            away from areas affected by heat waves and flooding. It is important to not forget
